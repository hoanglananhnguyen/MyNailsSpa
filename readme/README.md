# My Nails & Spa Project
![logo](logo-pink.png)

## Concept 
Women often to the nail shop without knowing which design is suit for their hands. Most of them search for the design beforehand but after it is done, it does not fit to their hands due to the matching of color and their skin, the design and their nail shape. My Nails & Spa Shop will help them to get a better experience.

## Final proposal
Based on the current skills, the concept was simplified to make it more practical. 

The highlight of the website is public user can not only sign up for a membership but also upload their look created by the technicians at the shop to their own gallery. Moreover, the photos would be updated to the Gallery of the homepage. Besides, "TRY ME" is a demo for interactive function will be built in the future. Here, public user can play a game by applying pattern, change color... to their nails.
